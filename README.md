# Retro-Photos for Weddings

Do you remember the "retro" days?
You'd be invited to a wedding, and you'd show up with your disposable camera to create some memories. You only had 24 photos! And you couldn't delete them like you can now. Once you took a shot, that was it! There was no turning back.

That situation created a lot of magic. You captured unique moments, and you only used it when you really wanted to preserve a memory in your photo album. You thought twice before taking a photo!

So, thinking about it...
Why not bring this to today?

"Retro-Photo" evokes a similar feeling, where each of your guests can only take 3 photos during the most important event of your life. The magic of the unexpected will return! There's no turning back. If you take a photo, it will be saved! And you won't know what photos there are until the next day.
